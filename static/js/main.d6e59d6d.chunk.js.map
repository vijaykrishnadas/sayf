The Platform allows the Users to buy and sell digital gold.

The SIP enables the member to buy gold and silver of a certain fixed amount every month and accumulate Gold/Silver at periodic intervals at a &ldquo;Configured Price&rdquo;. &#9679;The Configured Price for SIP shall be calculated by the Platform on every Business Day and shall be displayed on the Platform before 1 pm which shall be final and binding for everyone. A Business Day means any day other than Sunday or a day declared as holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 or a day on which normal business could not be transacted due to storms, floods, strikes, riots or any other events as Augmont may specify from time to time. &#9679;To start the SIP, the member needs to log in to his/her account, click on the SIP link and fill in a simple form specifying the choices and submit. After successfully submitting SIP application, the member will get a confirmation sms/email. &#9679;The member can start their SIP with the minimum amount of Rs. 1000 per month and can invest in multiples of Rs.1000 thereafter. &#9679;The member gets an option to buy additional quantities of gold and silver in the existing SIP and the said quantity shall be added to the SIP quantity for the tenure. The member can choose the duration of this SIP which can range from 1 year to 10 years. &#9679;The member gets an option to choose the SIP date cycle from the four options viz. 5th/12th/19th/26th of every month. e.g. If the member submits the SIP application on 7th October and selects the SIP cycle date as 12th of each month, then the SIP will initiate on 12th October. However, if they choose the SIP cycle date as 5th of each month, then the SIP start date will be 5th November. &#9679;One cannot change the amount of SIP, duration and cycle date once the request is submitted. In order to change one has to terminate the existing SIP and register for a new one. There are no charges currently for doing the same. &#9679;The frequency of buying is once per month. So, if the member chooses the SIP amount to be Rs 1000 per month in SIP, Rs. 1000 is utilized for purchasing the Gold/Silver. The Registered Member can request for termination of his existing SIP by contacting the customer help desk. SIP will be terminated only upon the completion of the current SIP cycle month. e.g. If the member has selected 5th of every month as his SIP cycle date and his SIP is active, and the member decides to exit the SIP on 10th of the month, the cycle will continue till 4th of next month and then terminate. At the end of SIP tenure or on SIP termination, the member may sell the gold and silver at the market price displayed on the Platform. Alternatively, the member can request for termination of his account with us in which case the gold and silver shall get sold at the market rate and the proceeds shall be remitted to the member's bank account. &#9679;You may not sell Gold / Silver under SIP but you can request the delivery of the gold and silver accumulated during the tenure of the SIP. Alternately you may sell the gold and silver under the SIP at the end of the tenure. &#9679;In case you miss your monthly SIP installment, you will be given a grace period of 60 days. Within the grace period, if you do not transfer sufficient funds in your account, then your SIP may be treated as &rsquo;defaulted&rsquo; and your SIP may be irreversibly terminated. &#9679;The SIP is neither a financial product nor a deposit scheme but a disciplined method of accumulating Gold/Silver. Augmont offers no investment advice or any assured returns while promoting the SIP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br/><h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR EMI </h2><br/>The Scheme is unique and shall not be linked to any other existing or future Schemes/Offers and is not transferable under any circumstances. &#9679;The product purchased and the specifications mentioned upon Order Confirmation cannot be changed during the tenure of the scheme and the Customer shall make the payments as per the payment schedule provided during Order confirmation.  &#9679;The money paid as booking amount under the Scheme shall not bear any interest. &#9679;Augmont shall issue a system generated Proforma Invoice to the customer at the time of Order Confirmation, a Payment Receipt upon payment of every EMI and Final Tax Invoice at the time of Delivery of the Product.
